Remember Me is default on WordPress Login Form, without JavaScript.

== Description ==

Places a check mark in the Remember Me checkbox on the standard WordPress login form.

Without a check mark in the Remember Me checkbox, your users will have to login every time they close their browser.  With Remember Me selected, they won't have to login again for two weeks.

There are other plugins that make Remember Me the default, but I wrote this plugin because I wanted a solution that did not require JavaScript, which was the solution used by every other plugin that I could find.  This plugin uses a documented standard WordPress Action ("hook") and a Post variable used by WordPress just for this purpose, i.e. - straight PHP with no JavaScript.

Deciding whether this plugin is for you:

* WordPress always leaves the Remember Me checkbox empty, even if you selected it the last time you logged on;
* Without Remember Me checked, logoff occurs automatically when the browser is closed or two days have passed;
* Without Remember Me checked, some browsers will force a login when opening a new browser window;
* With Remember Me checked, logoff occurs automatically in two weeks;
* With Remember Me checked, the user remains logged in even if the browser is closed, the user's computer is rebooted or the web site hosting server is rebooted;
* Web sites that can only be viewed by registered users (e.g. - [jonradio Private Site plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/jonradio-private-site/ "jonradio Private Site")) are more likely to want Remember Me pre-selected for each user at login, as web site viewing will be more frequently repeated than WordPress Administration;
* For public or shared computers, the WordPress behaviour of leaving the Remember Me checkbox empty is a slight Security improvement, but is easily defeated by a user selecting Remember Me during login, which still leaves subsequent users logged on.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the *jonradio Remember Me* plugin and get it working.

1. Use **Add Plugin** within the WordPress Admin panel to download and install this *jonradio Remember Me* plugin from the WordPress.org plugin repository (preferred method).  Or download and unzip this plugin, then upload the `/jonradio-remember-me/` directory to your WordPress web site's `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the *jonradio Remember Me* plugin through the **Installed Plugins** Admin panel in WordPress.  If you have a WordPress Network ("Multisite"), you can either **Network Activate** this plugin through the **Installed Plugins** Network Admin panel, or Activate it individually on the sites where you wish to use it.  Activating on individual sites within a Network avoids some of the confusion created by WordPress' hiding of Network Activated plugins on the Plugin menu of individual sites.  Alternatively, to avoid this confusion, you can install the *jonradio Reveal Network Activated Plugins* plugin.
1. The plugin should now be functioning.  There is no Settings page.  To stop the Remember Me default behaviour, Deactivate the *jonradio Remember Me* plugin through the **Installed Plugins** Admin panel in WordPress.  Or delete the `/jonradio-remember-me/` directory to your WordPress web site's `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this plugin work with other Login forms? =

It depends on whether the *other* Login form provides two standard technical features of the WordPress Login form generated by wp-login.php:

1. The "login_form_login" Action; and
1. The "rememberme" Post field.

Both are used by this plugin.

= How much Security am I sacrificing by using this plugin? =

It was a conscious security decision by WordPress developers to always present the standard WordPress Login form with the Remember Me checkbox empty.

On the other hand, savvy users quickly got into the habit of being sure the Remember Me checkbox was selected every time they logged on.

The security risk is very dependent on how many registered users will login using a public or other shared computer that does not have an effective mechanism built in for automatically deleting auth cookies when one person finishes and the next begins.  Of course, the biggest question to ask is:  What level of risk do other people using the same computer as a registered user pose?
